<b>SURICATA</b> – A high performance Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and Network Security Monitoring engine. Suricata inspects the network traffic using a powerful and extensive rules and signature language and has powerful Lua scripting support for detection of complex threats. Suricata implements a complete signature language to match on known threats, policy violations and malicious behavior. Suricata will also detect many anomalies in the traffic it inspects. Suricata can log HTTP requests, log and store TLS certificates, extract files from flows and store them to disk. The full PCAP capture support allows easy analysis. All this makes Suricata a powerful engine for your Network Security Monitoring (NSM).
 
<b>NMAP</b> - Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental information on each depending on the options used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports table”.  That table lists the port number and protocol, service name, and state. The state is either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered. The port table may also include software version details when version detection has been requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested (-sO), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols rather than listening ports. In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further information on targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

<b>NSLOOKUP</b> – The NsLookup tool allows you to query DNS servers for resource records. NsLookup queries the specified DNS server and retrieves the requested records that are associated with the domain name you provided. Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive. Interactive mode allows the user to query name servers for information about various hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain. Non-interactive mode is used to print just the name and requested information for a host or domain.

<b>WHOIS</b> - Whois is a service that provides basic information about a registered domain, such as domain owner contact information, IP address block, domain availability status and the company with which the domain is registered. Whois is a query and response protocol that stores and delivers information related to the registered domain in a human-readable format. 

<b>OSCAP</b> - Open Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) toolkit based on OpenSCAP library. It provides various functions for different SCAP specifications(modules).OpenSCAP tool claims to provide capabilities of Authenticated Configuration Scanner and Authenticated Vulnerability Scanner as defined by The National Institute of Standards and Technology.

<b>SCAP-WORKBENCH</b> – A graphical utility tool that offers an easy way to perform common OSCAP (Open Security Content Automation Protocol) tasks. The tool allows users to perform configuration and vulnerability scans on a single local or remote system; In addition, the tool can perform remediation of the system in accordance with given XCCDF or SDS files. SCAP-Workbench can also generate reports containing the results of the system scan. 

<b>LASTPASS</b> - LastPass is a password manager that stores encrypted passwords online. A user's content in LastPass, including passwords and secure notes, is protected by one master password. The content is synchronized to any device the user uses the LastPass software or app extensions on. Information is encrypted with AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2 SHA-256, salted hashes, and the ability to increase password iterations value. Encryption and decryption take place at the device level.

<b>NETSTAT</b>- A utility that displays network connections for Transmission Control Protocol, routing tables, and a number of network interface and network protocol statistics. It is used for finding problems in the network and to determine the amount of traffic on the network as a performance measurement.

<b>OSQUERY</b> – OSquery is an operating system instrumentation framework for Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD. The tools make low-level operating system analytics and monitoring both performant and intuitive. The high-performance and low-footprint distributed host monitoring daemon, OSqueryd, allows you to schedule queries to be executed across your entire infrastructure. The daemon takes care of aggregating the query results over time and generates logs which indicate state changes in your infrastructure. You can use this to maintain insight into the security, performance, configuration, and state of your entire infrastructure. OSqueryd’s logging can integrate into your internal log aggregation pipeline. 

<b>IPTRAF</b> - IPTraf is a network monitoring utility for IP networks. It intercepts packets on the network and gives out various pieces of information about the current IP traffic over it. IPTraf can be used to monitor the load on an IP network, the most used types of network services, the proceedings of TCP connections, and others. IPTraf is software-only and utilizes the built-in raw packet capture interface of the Linux kernel, allowing it to be used with a wide range of Ethernet cards, supported FDDI adapters, supported ISDN adapters, and any asynchronous SLIP/PPP interface. No special hardware is required.

<b>NTOPNG</b> – A passive network monitoring tool focused on flows and statistics that can be obtained from the traffic captured by the server. NTOPNG centers and has been developed around some basic concepts that include network interfaces and hosts. It can generate alerts to report the occurrence of events and user-configurable thresholds. 

<b>OPENVAS</b> – OpenVAS is a full-featured vulnerability scanner. Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low-level Internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans and a powerful internal programming language to implement any type of vulnerability test. The scanner is accompanied by a vulnerability tests feed with a long history and daily updates. This Greenbone Community Feed includes more than 50,000 vulnerability tests.

<b>WIRESHARK</b> – Wireshark is the world’s most foremost and widely-used network packet analyzer. It is a free and open-source packet analyzer. A network packet analyzer presents captured packet data in as much detail as possible. Wireshark can capture traffic from many different network media types, including Ethernet, Wireless LAN, Bluetooth, USB, and more. 

<b>NODEJS</b> - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
